   <div class="about">
    <h1 style="display:block;text-align: center;margin-top:10px;">ABOUT US</h1>
    <p style="height: auto;width:auto;padding:10px;margin:10px;">Opening the world to everyone is at the heart of GetYourGuide. Founded by classmates Johannes, Tao, Martin, and Tobias in 2009, a travel mix-up sparked a revolutionary approach to tourism. When Johannes landed a day early in Beijing, he spent his time wandering the streets, not knowing where to go or what to do. It wasn’t until Tao arrived on the scene to act as a local guide that the duo was able to experience their destination fully. Back in Zurich, with a defined vision for the future, our founders decided to change the world of travel. The result? A platform that gathers the best activities across the globe, all in one place.
